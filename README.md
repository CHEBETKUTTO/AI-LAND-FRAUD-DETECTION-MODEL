🧠 Land Fraud Detection — AI Model trains and evaluates an AI model to detect potential **land fraud cases**, using structured land record data.  **Features:** - Preprocessing of categorical and numerical land data Model training using RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost Feature importance visualization https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QcSjVq3JqZikpAxjk-QCjMD1XCoBDSAs?usp=sharing

Part one of the assignement:
Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
Ans.

PyTorch → Better for learning, research, and rapid prototyping; More intuitive, easier debugging, beginner-friendly

TensorFlow → Better for production deployment at scale; Steeper learning curve, improved with Keras integration.

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
Ans.

🧪 1. Interactive Model Development & Experimentation

Use Case:
Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for building, testing, and iterating on machine learning or deep learning models interactively.

Why it’s useful:

You can write code, visualize data, and see results immediately — all in one place.

Helps tune hyperparameters and analyze model performance step by step.

You can combine code, markdown notes, and visualizations to track experiments.

Example:
A data scientist developing an AI model for land fraud detection might:

Load and explore the dataset using pandas and matplotlib.

Train models using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Plot accuracy/loss curves and confusion matrices to evaluate performance.

Document findings inline for easy understanding.

📊 2. Data Exploration & Visualization

Use Case:
Jupyter Notebooks are perfect for exploratory data analysis (EDA) — a critical first step in AI workflows.

Why it’s useful:

Supports interactive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

Libraries like pandas, seaborn, and plotly integrate smoothly.

You can detect trends, correlations, and anomalies before model training.

Example:
An AI engineer analyzing satellite or land registry data might:

Load property ownership datasets.

Use visualizations to spot fraudulent land patterns (e.g., duplicated coordinates, inconsistent owner data).

Clean and prepare the data directly in the same notebook for the model.

🧩 Summary
Use Case	Description	Tools Commonly Used
Model development & experimentation	Train, test, and fine-tune AI models interactively	TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
Data exploration & visualization	Clean, explore, and visualize data patterns	pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
Ans.

Basic Python handles text at a **surface level** — just characters and words.
* **spaCy** adds **linguistic intelligence** — it understands grammar, meaning, and context.

✅ **spaCy advantages:**

* Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, lemmatization.
* Much **faster** and **more accurate** for large-scale NLP tasks.
* Ready-to-use **pre-trained language models** for AI applications.

**In short:**

> Basic Python manipulates text; spaCy *understands* it.
